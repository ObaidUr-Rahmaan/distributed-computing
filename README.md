# distributed-computing

## Concepts covered during module:
- Effective Multi-threaded programming on a single CPU (C pthreads, Java Thread Library, locks)
- GPU programming and Architectures (CUDA: memory, caching, warps etc.)
- Large-Scale Distributed Computing (Data centres, efficient graph traversal, synchronized clocks, snapshot algorithms for real-time systems)
