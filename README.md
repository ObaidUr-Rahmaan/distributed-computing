Other concepts covered during module:
- Effective Multi-threaded programming (on a single CPU)
- GPU programming and Architectures (memory, caching, warps etc.)
- Large-Scale Distributed Computing (Data centres, efficient graph traversal, synchronized clocks, snapshot algorithms for real-time systems)
